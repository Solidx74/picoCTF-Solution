Solution Approach for Log Hunt
Step 1: Examine the log file

The log contains various system events (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG) with timestamps. Among these, there are special "FLAGPART" entries that contain pieces of the flag.
Step 2: Extract FLAGPART lines

grep FLAGPART server.log


Step 3: Then Remove duplicates and sort chronologically


grep FLAGPART server.log | sort -u

You should get the flag then.
