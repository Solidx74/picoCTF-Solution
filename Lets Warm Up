Solution Approach for Lets Warm Up

    Understanding the Problem

        The problem states that a word starts with 0x70 in hexadecimal.

        We need to find what this starting character would be in ASCII.

        Finally, wrap the result in picoCTF{} to form the flag.

    Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

        Hexadecimal 0x70 means:

            First digit 7 is in the 16¹ place

            Second digit 0 is in the 16⁰ place

        Formula: (7 × 16¹) + (0 × 16⁰)

        Calculation: (7 × 16) + 0 = 112 + 0 = 112 (decimal)

    Decimal to ASCII Conversion

        ASCII value 112 corresponds to the lowercase letter 'p'

        (Reference: Standard ASCII table shows 97='a', 98='b', ..., 112='p')

    Flag Formation

        The character found is p
