 Solution Approach For Scavenger Hunt
The challenge involves finding five hidden parts of a flag across different files on the website. Here is the step-by-step method:

First Part: HTML Comment

Visit the main page: http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/

Open the page's source code (usually Ctrl+U or right-click → "View Page Source").

Look for an HTML comment (<!-- ... -->). The first part of the flag is hidden there.

Second Part: CSS File

In the source code, find the tag linking the CSS file (e.g., mycss.css).

Access the CSS file directly: http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/mycss.css (or whatever the filename is).

The second part of the flag is commented out within the CSS file.

Third Part: robots.txt

The JavaScript file contains a hint about preventing Google from indexing the site.

Access the standard robots.txt file: http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/robots.txt

This file will contain the third part of the flag.

Fourth Part: .htaccess

The robots.txt file mentions an Apache server and asks if you can access the next flag.

Try accessing the Apache directory-level configuration file: http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.htaccess

This file will reveal the fourth part of the flag.

Fifth Part: .DS_Store

The .htaccess file contains a hint about making websites on a Mac and storing lots of information.

This points to the macOS system file .DS_Store.

Access the file: http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/.DS_Store

Opening or downloading this file will provide the final part of the flag.

Combine the Flag

Once you have all five parts, combine them in the correct order to form the complete flag. The flag format is typically picoCTF{...}.
