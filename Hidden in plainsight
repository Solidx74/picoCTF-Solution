Solution Approach for Hidden in plainsight
Step 1: Examine the image metadata

The first step is to check if the image contains any hidden information in its metadata using exiftool:
bash

exiftool img.jpg

This reveals a comment field with what appears to be base64 encoded data:
text

Comment                         : c3RlZ2hpZGU6Y0VGNmVuZHZjbVE9

Step 2: Decode the base64 comment

The comment is base64 encoded, so we decode it:
bash

echo "c3RlZ2hpZGU6Y0VGNmVuZHZjbVE9" | base64 -d

This gives us another encoded string: steghide:cEF6endvcmQ=
Step 3: Perform second base64 decoding

The result from step 2 contains another base64 string after the colon:
bash

echo "cEF6endvcmQ=" | base64 -d

This reveals the password: pAzzword

The format "steghide:password" suggests we need to use the steghide tool with this password.
Step 4: Install steghide (if not already installed)
bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install steghide

Step 5: Extract hidden data from the image

Using steghide with the discovered password:
bash

steghide extract -sf img.jpg -p pAzzword

Output:
text

wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".

Step 6: View the extracted flag
bash

cat flag.txt
