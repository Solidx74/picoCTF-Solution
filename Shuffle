1.After downloading the file , go to terminal and do the following:
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cd Downloads         
                                                                                                                                                                      
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ ls              
output.txt
                                                                                                                                                                      
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ cat output.txt       
75}9cbd89gv_f_ldetbmlrc8{FsCoTipc 

2. There we can see an encrypted text.Characters at indices i, i+1, i+2 have been rearranged to become i+2, i, i+1.
3. So if we just rearrange it . we will get the flag pretty easily. Problem solved.
