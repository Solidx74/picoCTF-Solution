Solution Approach for Flag in Flame


Step 1: Initial File Analysis

We begin with a file named logs.txt in the Downloads directory:
bash

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cd Downloads
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ ls
logs.txt

Step 2: Decoding Base64 Content

The logs.txt file contains Base64-encoded data. We decode it and save the output as a JPEG image:
bash

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ cat logs.txt | base64 -d >> demo.jpeg

What happened here:

    The cat command reads the contents of logs.txt

    The output is piped (|) to the base64 -d command, which decodes Base64 data

    The decoded data is redirected (>>) to a new file called demo.jpeg

Step 3: Image Analysis

After generating demo.jpeg, the file was examined. The image appeared to be a standard JPEG, but visual inspection didn't immediately reveal the flag.
Step 4: Using Google Lens for Reverse Image Search

The image was uploaded to Google Lens (or Google Reverse Image Search) to see if it contained any hidden patterns or text that wasn't immediately visible to the naked eye.

Result: The image contained or was associated with a hexadecimal string.
Step 5: Hexadecimal Decoding

The discovered hexadecimal string was then processed using an online hex decoder:

Tool used: https://cryptii.com/pipes/hex-decoder

Process:

    Navigated to the cryptii hex decoder page

    Pasted the hexadecimal string into the input field

    The decoder converted the hex to ASCII text

Step 6: Flag Retrieval

The hexadecimal decoding revealed the flag in plain text.
