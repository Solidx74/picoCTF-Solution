Solution Approach for PicoCTF 2019 "Logon" Challenge
Challenge Overview
Event: PicoCTF 2019

Category: Web Exploitation

Challenge Name: Logon

Difficulty: Easy

Goal: Login as "Joe" to retrieve the flag

Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance
Access the challenge URL: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/

Observe the login page: Simple form with username and password fields

Read the hint: "The factory is hiding things from all of its users" and "Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?"

Step 2: Test Login Functionality
Try random credentials (e.g., username: "test", password: "123")

Observe the result: You get logged in successfully!

Check for the flag: Navigate to the flag page but notice you can't access it

Step 3: Analyze Network Traffic
Open Browser Developer Tools (F12)

Go to Network tab

Attempt login again with random credentials

Observe the requests:

First request: 307 redirect

Second request: Actual login POST request

Flag endpoint requests: Similar pattern with redirects

Step 4: Examine Request Headers
Find the flag endpoint request in Network tab

Inspect Request Headers - Notice two critical issues:

Plain text credentials in headers

Admin boolean flag: admin=False in the Cookie header

Step 5: Exploit the Vulnerability
The admin flag suggests client-side authorization - easily manipulable!

Method 1: Using Browser Developer Tools
After logging in with any credentials

Open Developer Tools → Application tab → Cookies

Change the admin value from False to True

Refresh the flag page

Method 2: Using cURL (Recommended)
Copy the flag request as cURL:

In Network tab, right-click on flag request

Select Copy → Copy as cURL

Modify the cURL command:

bash
# Original command (with admin=False)
curl 'https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/flag' \
  -H 'Cookie: password=random; username=test; admin=False' \
  --compressed

# Modified command (admin=True)
curl 'https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/flag' \
  -H 'Cookie: password=random; username=test; admin=True' \
  --compressed
Execute the modified command in terminal and it should show the flag.
