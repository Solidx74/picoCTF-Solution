Solution Approach for Intro to Burp
Challenge Description

Website: http://titan.picoctf.net:58401
Objective: Find the flag by exploiting improper input validation
Approach Summary

This challenge demonstrates a common web security vulnerability where insufficient input validation leads to information disclosure. The flag is obtained by manipulating the OTP (One-Time Password) field in a POST request.
Detailed Solution Steps
Step 1: Reconnaissance

    Use Burp Suite to intercept and analyze traffic

    Identify endpoints: / and /dashboard

    Note HTTP methods: GET and POST requests for both endpoints

Step 2: Initial Analysis

Endpoint Analysis:
- GET  /          → 200 OK (HTML)
- POST /          → 302 Redirect (HTML)
- GET  /dashboard → 200 OK (HTML)
- POST /dashboard → 200 OK (Text)

Step 3: Request Manipulation

    Send the /dashboard POST request to Repeater in Burp Suite

    Identify the OTP parameter in the request body

Step 4: Vulnerability Discovery

Test the OTP field with different inputs:

    Numeric OTP → "Invalid OTP" (expected behavior)

    Text OTP → "Invalid OTP" (unexpected - no validation error)

    Empty OTP → FLAG revealed (critical finding)

Step 5: Flag Retrieval

    Remove the OTP parameter entirely from the POST request

    Send the modified request

    Capture the flag from the server's response

Key Vulnerability

The server fails to validate the OTP field properly:

    Accepts non-numeric input without validation errors

    Does not enforce OTP presence requirement

    When OTP is missing, falls back to revealing sensitive information

Tools Used

    Burp Suite (Proxy, Target, Repeater)

    Web browser for initial access
